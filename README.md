## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for submit button
- Validate if the input is filled or not

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS functions
- forEach method

### What I learned

The difficulty I had here was to select both input and required text related to each input individually. At first, whether the red text appeared under all the inputs or none. At least, I could finnally realise I had to use `const[index].classList` and everything worked out as it should


### Continued development

I'm looking forward to practicing some more JavaScript properties. Comparing to my last project, I already felt more easiness working with HTML and CSS properties, which means I can feel my improvement.
